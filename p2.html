    <p><h3><ul>.     Biles grew up in Spring, Texas, in the Houston metropolitan area, after she and her sister <br>
      Adria were adopted by their grandparents, Ronald and Nellie Biles.<br>     Simone became interested in gymnastics at age six
      during a day-care field trip to Bannon’s Gymnastix,<br>
           and she remained there for 11 years under the direction of her coach, Aimee Boorman.<br> 
           Biles won a gold in floor exercise and a bronze in vault at the Women’s Junior Olympic National Championships in 2010 before breaking 
      into the elite level of competition in 2011.<br>
          Less than two years later she dominated the sport.<br>      What set Biles apart was her consistency, her exuberant personality,<br>
           and the high degree of difficulty she incorporated into her routines in all four events—vault,<br>
           uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise.</ul></h3></p>
