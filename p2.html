    <p><h3>Biles grew up in Spring, Texas, in the Houston metropolitan area, after she and her sister 
      Adria were adopted by their grandparents, Ronald and Nellie Biles. Simone became interested in gymnastics at age six
      during a day-care field trip to Bannon’s Gymnastix,
      and she remained there for 11 years under the direction of her coach, Aimee Boorman. 
      Biles won a gold in floor exercise and a bronze in vault at the Women’s Junior Olympic National Championships in 2010 before breaking 
      into the elite level of competition in 2011.
      Less than two years later she dominated the sport. What set Biles apart was her consistency, her exuberant personality,
      and the high degree of difficulty she incorporated into her routines in all four events—vault,
      uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise.</h3></p>
